# The Ableist Architecture of Queer Spaces
_How ableism can play into event planning_

## What is Ableism?
  * Systemic injustice against disabled people
  * It's not one force, one source
  * There is a plethora of things that affect disabled people
  * Not all disabled people experience ableism in the same way
    * Example: Imagine a presentation that uses a projector in a bright room, and where the presenters are not using microphones
      * A hard of hearing person might not be able to hear the presenters
      * A visually impaired person might not be able to see the slides
      * A cane using person might not be affected by these conditions at all
    * _All 3 are disabled_, regardless of how their disabilities interacted with the obstacles in the presentation
    * All 3 experience the barriers in the presentation _in different ways_
  * There can be conflicting access needs
    * Example: A hard of hearing person might need flashing lights for their phone notifications, but that might be really bad for someone in the room who has epilepsy
    * This _doesn't_ mean accessibility is impossible or that it shouldn't be pursued
      * The ASAN resource below has examples and solutions for conflicts of needs



## Takeaways
  * Don't push thinking about accessibility in your planning to the last minute
    * If you do, then your event will probably be more inaccessible for it
    * Start thinking about accesibility _from the start_
  * Use grants to help pay for accesibility
    * Search your state's [Center for Independent Living](https://acl.gov/programs/aging-and-disability-networks/centers-independent-living) for local grants
      * Local grants will have less competition
    * [The Awesome Foundation](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en) gives grants
      * They have [one specifically for disability](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/disability)
  * Don't ever tap out on local resources
    * They can have materials, tools, and information that can really help you out when planning accessible events
  * ASAN has a list of [accessibilty checkpoints](https://issuu.com/autselfadvocacy/docs/accessible-event-planning) that can help you make sure your event is more accessible
    * It most likely has things you hadn't thought of

  * Where should I give my resources/money to in order to help disability justice
