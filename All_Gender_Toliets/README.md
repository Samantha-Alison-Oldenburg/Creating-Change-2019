# How to Advocate for All Gender Toliets: Lessons from Chicago
***
## Sam's Disclaimer
This is a hard problem with no magic solution. Transgender issues regarding bathrooms are both legislatively and publically controversey at this point in time. If you want to see all gender toliets in your facility, it will take work.

Keep on talking to the people that have the authority to make the decision to implement them. People don't see this as a problem, so you will need to come with reasons why this is important. Bring good arguments that having some all gender bathrooms would benefit the facility.

Use PR/Talent reasons. Compare your facility to similar/competitors that have all gender toliets. Talk about trail blazing. Talk about how it makes good trans talent want to come and stay here. As a trans person, an all gender bathroom on the job would be a huge perk to me. Most trans people WILL feel the same way.

Make a legal battle as a last resort. Use state protections on gender idendity. Use local protections on gender identity. Use federal regulations regarding gender identity.

In cases where nothing works, education about trans people througout the facility is the next best step. Get people comfortable with trans coworkers/guest. Make those trans people feel a little less scared of ignorance causing problems.

## Background
### Who benefits from All Gender Restrooms (AGR's)?
  * Everyone
    * Deconstructs gender binary
    * Deconstruct sexualization of bodies
  * Trans people
    * It's a health issue!
      * Trans people will often not use a bathroom if they don't feel comfortable using one.
      * This leads to health problems
        * Urinary Tract Infections
        * Bladder Cancer
        * Kidney disease
        * Dehyrdation if trans people drink less in order to not need to relieve themselves in a place without accessible bathrooms
    * It's a huge source of anxiety
  * Legal Teams
    * Helps keep you compliant with Title VII and Title IX of the Civil Rights act
  * Parents with opposite sex children
    * Single dad shouldn't have to send his 3 year old daughter into a restroom by herself
    * Diaper changing spaces
  * Care-takers of the elderly

### What is the pushback on creating all gender restrooms?
  * Controversey
    * Transgender identities are not universally seen as valid
  * Risk of Crime
    * Many people claim it will increase assault and harrassment towards women
    * This isn't proven, localities that allow for people to choose their bathroom show no such spike in crime
  * Plumbing Codes (potentially)
    * Most state plumbing codes have sections determining how much bathrooms your facility offers to each sex
    * Check your state and local laws
    * Check the regulations of the agencies that enforce these laws
      * Most agencies will allow a toliet in a designated unisex restroom to count as half of a men's and women's toliet when counting toliets
        * I.e. 2 unisex toliets is equivalent to 1 toliet in a women's restroom and 1 toliet in the men's restroom

### Why are Bathrooms Sex Segregated
  * Actually started in mid 1800's as women accessed the public space more
    * Before that most women lived domestic lives

### Discriminatory Bathroom Bills
  * A few years ago, many state legislatures made bills to force trans people to use bathroom of their assigned sex
  * North Carolina actually passed one such law
    * It got repealed later

## Chicago Restroom Access Project (CRAP)
  * Project in Chicago
  * Creates resources to advocate for restroom accessibility for trans people

## Solutions
  * Single stall bathrooms can be converted to gender neutral bathrooms
  * When doing renovations, create single stall restrooms
  * If you have several multi-stall restrooms for men and women, turn one of them into an all gender restrooms
    * There will still be sex segregated restrooms for people who don't feel comfortable using the all gender restrooms
  * Listen to trans people's stories
    * It's hard to conceptualize a barrier to such a taken for granted part of life
    * Many people don't even realize the problems
    * Trans people have been victims of violence for trying to use bathrooms
  * **Bathrooms also need to be accessible to people with disabilities!**
