# Dismantling White Toxic Culture #

## Negative Characteristics of Organization ##

### Perfectionism ###
Focusing energy on trying to get things right the first time to the point that no work gets done.

#### Remedies ####
  * Culture of Appreciation
  * Develop a learning organization
  * Learning what a mistake is
    * Is it a mistake or something that doesn't "align" with the organization
  * Focus on what went well first before criticisms

### Sense of Urgency ###
Skipping steps in order to complete tasks sooner. In a white toxic culture this will often just throw the needs of people of color under the bus.

#### Remedies ####
  * Realistic work plans
  * Leadership allows time to make decisions
  * Realistic funding

### Defensiveness ###
Focusing time and energy to protect the power structure and not giving power to marginalized folks.

#### Remedies ####
  * Step down and give space for a person of color to step into leadership
  * Give time, space, and support to people of color in the ways that _they_ need it
  * More privileged folks should pave the way for more marginalized folks

### Worship of Written Word ###
If it's not in the google doc, it doesn't exist. Everything legitimate has to be written down and emailed to your supervisor.

#### Remedies ####
  * Value other forms of communications
  * learn how to communicate with each other and hold people accountable to those forms of communications
  * Throw "formal communication" out the window
    * It comes from toxic culture
    * Communication should be taken as legitimate regardless of how it is worded
  * Understand accessibility/language and other differences in communications

### Paternalism ###
White people thinking they can make the decisions and know what's best for everyone else. Hiding or not including rationalities for decisions

#### Remedies ####
  * Leaders should be honest and transparent in reasons behind decisions
  * Leaders shouldn't think they know the needs and what's best for people on all levels of the organization
  * Include people that are affected by decision making
    * White people should not make decisions on behalf of people of color

### Either/Or Thinking ###
Breaking down problems into binary decisions. Often results in needless compromise.

#### Remedies ####
  * Notice either/or thinking and encourage thinking of more options

### Power Hoarding ###
Not giving up power and making decisions for all members of organization

#### Remedies ####
  * Stop making decisions for everyone
    * If you hold people accountable for tasks, give them responsibility over the task
  * Allow people to grow
  * Don't see other organizations members as incapable
  * Don't give people tasks, give them goals


## Other Takeaways ##
  * Stop expecting people to come to your events
    * Go to them
  * Privileged people can't define what success is for maginalized folks
  * Privileged people: if you're comfortable, you're probably not doing the work right
    * Growth and comfort do not coexist
