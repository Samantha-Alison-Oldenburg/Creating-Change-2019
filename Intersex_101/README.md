## What is the Sex Binary?
  * According to the sex binary, sex is determined by:
    * Chromosomes
    * Internal and external genitalia
    * Balance of sex hormones
    * Internal reproductive anatomy
  * Idea that there are two sexes
    * Male
    * Female

## What is Intersex?
  * Someone who's sex cannot be classified as female or male
  * It is not being transgender
    * However someone can be both transgender and intersex
  * Examples:
    * Differences in types or amount of hormones
    * Differences in type or amount of chromosomes
    * Having external genitalia that cannot be classified as male or femail
  * It's decisive evidence _against_ the sex binary
  * It's more common than you think
    * The rate of intersex births is the same as natural redheads
    * That's **2 percent** of the population

## Experiences of Intersex people
  * Here's a [video from intersex activist Pigeon Pagonisw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9q7ic533Vk)

## Intersex Genital Mutilation (IGM)
  * Surgery done on the to modify, reduce or remove the genitals or gonads of intersex people
  * The doctors often claim they are medical necessities
    * The _actual need_ for surgery is slim to none
  * These can happen to an intersex person when they are infants
    * Most intersex people never get to choose whether they _want_ these surgeries
    * Many intersex people don't even find out surgery was performed on them until they're teenagers
    * Sometimes doctors perform these surgeries on infants without the consent of the parent

### Goals of IGM
  * To enable heterosexual penetrative intercourse
  * To help child conform to gender and sexual norms
    * Surgeons performing surgery so someone can stand while urinating

### Complications of IGM
  * Here's a [video where intersex people talk about their experiences with IGM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT4dDO-ZwcQ)
  * Diminished Quality of health, sexual function
  * 22-36% experience major health complicatioons
    * 68% of patients experience long term complications
    * This leads to people potentially needing over 40 surgeries in the future, in some cases
  * Gender Dysphoria
  * Diminished autonomy
  * Pain


### Experts on IGM
> Children who are born with atypical sex characteristics are often subject to irreversible sex assignment, involuntary sterilization, involuntary genital normalizing surgery, performed without their informed consent, or that of their parents, “in an attempt to fix their sex”, [107] leaving them with permanent, irreversible infertility and causing severe mental suffering.

> The United Nations, [Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf), paragraph 77
***
> When an individual is born with atypical genitalia that pose no physical risk, treatment should focus not on surgical intervention but on psychosocial and educational support for the family and child. Cosmetic genitoplasty should be deferred until children are old enough to voice their own view about whether to undergo the surgery. Those whose oath or conscience says “do no harm” should heed the simple fact that, to date, research does not support the practice of cosmetic infant genitoplasty.
