# Physically and Visibly Disabled in Queer Spaces #

## What Makes Spaces Unwelcoming to Physically and Visibly Disabled Folks ##
### Physical Access issues ###
  * Not using microphones
  * Getting to the space being difficult/inaccessible
    * Lack of elevators/ramp
    * Icy sidewalks
    * Narrow hallways
    * Far from public transit options
  * Room setup
    * Circular seat setup mean people can't get out easily
      * Use parenthesis insted (two curving rows with big spaces on either side)
    * Rooms being too small means people with mobility tools can't get around as easily
  * Not allowing certain/all mobility devices
  * No braile documents or other resources for blind and visually impaired people
### Emotionally unwelcoming ###
  * Tokenizing
  * Questioning someone's disability
    * "How disabled _are_ you?"
  * Using other intersections to disbelieve disability
    * "You're not disabled. You just have trouble moving because you're _overweight_"
  * Waiting for disabled people to tell you something isn't accessible before they change that
  * No disabled people in your marketing, pamphlets, etc.
  * When being upset about ableism seen as "dividing the front" but you have to be up in arms when someone is being homophobic, racist, etc.
  * Not presenting an event in a way that let's you know that accessibilty is a focus

## How to Make Spaces More Welcoming ##

> Accessibility can be difficult, expensive, and hard work. However, it is worth it. We are worth it.

  * Think about accessibility from the start of planning
    * ASAN has a list of [accessibilty checkpoints](https://issuu.com/autselfadvocacy/docs/accessible-event-planning) that can help you make sure your event is more accessible
  * If a disabled person brings up something that's wrong
    1. Believe them
    2. Do whatever you can in the moment to mitigate the issue
    3. Include it in your planning next time
  * Don't speak over people about their experiences
    * You're not an expert on their life
    * Advocate for them, but pass the mic to them when they're there
  * Make spaces inclusive toward neurodiverse people
  * If you can't afford some accessibility features, apply for a grant
    * Search your state's [Center for Independent Living](https://acl.gov/programs/aging-and-disability-networks/centers-independent-living) for local grants
      * Local grants will have less competition
    * [The Awesome Foundation](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en) gives grants
      * They have [one specifically for disability](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/disability)
  * Don't ever tap out on local resources
    * They can have materials, tools, and information that can really help you out when planning accessible events
  * Have disabled people be on your team
    * Give them leadership power
    * Listen to them
    * Make sure you don't have _just one_ disabled person on your leadership team
  * Include disabled people in you media/advertising
