# Creating Change 2019 Notes
In January 2019, I went to a conference focused on radical, intersectional justice in LGBT community. My goal was to get information to create accessible events and employee resource groups at workplaces. Most workshops are focused on queer intersections, but can still be useful due to the intersectional nature of these workshops.
